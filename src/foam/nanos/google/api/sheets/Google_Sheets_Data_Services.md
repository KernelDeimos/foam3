#Google export related services 
GoogleApiAuthService takes care of setting up authorization flow.
GoogleDriveService takes care of making calls to Google Drive APIs, with which we can create files and directories.
GoogleSheetsApiService takes in data that we want to export and its metadata (which type of the cell should be used to display values) and sends requests to GoogleSheetsApi to create new sheet or copy existing one (which we do there is a template that user would like to use).

#Google Sheets template
To create a Google Sheet templete:
1. Create a new sheet with Google Sheets or use excisting one
2. Leave first sheet empty. There should be nothing in there
3. Add your formula, charts and any other components of template on sheets other then first one
4. Make your sheet accesible to anyone
